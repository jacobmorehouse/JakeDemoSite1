Products: 'Discontinued' should be a bool. Need to display and use it that way.

Display: 
-On products page, show all products that are below and near their reorder level so that someone knows that they need to reorder them? 
-show products by category
-show products by supplier
-show orders per Employee (maybe also over time)


Finish building all CRUDs.
